# Markdown Writing Guidelines

When writing or generating markdown content:

## Style Requirements
- **No emojis**: Never include emoji characters in markdown files
- **Concise sentences**: Use short, direct sentences that convey information efficiently
- **Technical tone**: Avoid marketing language, superlatives, and promotional phrasing

## Examples

**Bad:**
```markdown
🚀 Our amazing platform makes it super easy to deploy your awesome applications! 
You'll love how incredibly simple and powerful it is! ✨
```

**Good:**
```markdown
Deploy applications using the platform CLI or API. The deployment process takes 2-5 minutes.
```

## Specific Patterns to Avoid
- Exclamation marks (except in code examples or warnings)
- Words like: amazing, awesome, incredible, revolutionary, game-changing
- Phrases like: "you'll love", "easily", "simply", "just"
- Any emoji or decorative unicode characters

## Preferred Approach
- State facts and features directly
- Use technical specifications and concrete details
- Include command examples and code snippets
- Focus on "what" and "how" rather than "how great"
