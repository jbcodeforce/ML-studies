# A set of simple studies and solutions

## Predict whether a mammogram mass is benign or malignant

* **Data**: The dataset can be found from University of Irvine: [Mammographic Mass](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/161/mammographic+mass). 
* **Goal**: Build a Multi-Layer Perceptron and train it to classify masses as benign or malignant based on its features.
* **Challenges**: The data needs to be cleaned; many rows contain missing data, and there may be erroneous data identifiable as outliers as well.
* **Approach**:

    * Review data quality, and missing data. Drop if not a lot of records are wrong
    * Transform the data to be usable by sklearn using numpy
