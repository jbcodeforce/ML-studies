# Neuro Symbolic AI

Neuro Symbolic AI combines elements of neural networks and symbolic reasoning to develop intelligent systems. Neural networks excel at pattern recognition and learning from data, while  traditional AI like rule engines focuses on logic, reasoning, and symbolic representations.

The goal is to create more interpretable, explainable, and robust AI systems.

Symbolic reasoning can operate on the structured knowledge graph to perform tasks such as question answering, knowledge inference, and logical reasoning.

Knowledge graphs represent information in a structured and semantically rich manner, using entities, relationships, and attributes

LLMs are trained on static document sets, which means gaps exist with newly created knowledge. RAG helps to address this problem, but there is still gaps in semantic controlled response.

## Use Cases

* **Healthcare**: Deep learning can do medical images or analog graph pattern recognition, predictive analytics, classification, with symbolic reasoning to deliver personalized treatment recommendations, or help on diagnostic.
* **Complaint management:** combine workflow, chatbot, decision rules for next best actions, product recommendation, ML for sentiment analysis.
