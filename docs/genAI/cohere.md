## Products

[Three main products](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/the-cohere-platform): Command for LLM, Embed, and Rerank.

### Command-R

A LLM optimized for long-context task, and to support enterprise deployments using: 

* Advanced Retrieval Augmented Generation with citation to reduce hallucinations
* 128K context length
* Multilingual coverage in 10 key languages to support global business operations
* Tool Use to automate sophisticated business processes using single-step tool or multi-step tool like an agent

### Embed

Embeddings can be used for estimating semantic similarity between two texts, choosing a sentence which is most likely to follow another sentence, or categorizing user feedback. Embed improves the accuracy of search, classification, clustering, and RAG results.
Cohere embedding associates each word with a vector of length 4096. It supports more than 100 languages.

### Rerank

Rerank models sort text inputs by semantic relevance to a specified query. They are often used to sort search results returned from an existing search solution. 
Rerank is used to inject the intelligence of a language model into an existing search system.
