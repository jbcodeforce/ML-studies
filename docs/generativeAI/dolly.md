# Dolly

[Dolly 2.0](https://huggingface.co/databricks/dolly-v2-12b) is built the first open source, instruction-following Large Language Model by Databricks in partnership with Huggingface. It comes with 3b or 12b parameters trained models. 

The model is based on the [eleuther](https://www.eleuther.ai/) (a non-profit AI research lab focusing on Large models) with 6b parameter model named Pythia. On top of this model, Databricks created human generated prompts (around $15k). 

[ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt), a proprietary instruction-following model, was released in November 2022. The model was trained on trillions of words from the web, requiring massive numbers of GPUs to develop. The model was trained using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), using the same methods as [InstructGPT](), but with different data collection setup.
