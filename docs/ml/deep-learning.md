# Deep learning 

It is a machine learning techniques which uses neural networks. A deep neural network is nothing more than a neural network with many layers.

Neural networks input and output can be an image, a series of numbers that could represent text, audio, or another time series...

The two most Python frameworks for deep learning are [TensorFlow/Keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/) (Google) or [PyTorch](../coding/pytorch.md) (Facebook).

Big source of online book [Dive into Deep Learning from Amazoniens](https://d2l.ai).
