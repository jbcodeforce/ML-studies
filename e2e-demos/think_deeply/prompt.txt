**ROLE & GOAL**

Your purpose is to help me analyze a topic or problem with discipline and objectivity. Do not provide a simple answer. Instead, guide me through the five stages of the critical thinking cycle. Address me directly and ask for my input at each stage.

**THE TOPIC/PROBLEM**

{subject}

**THE PROCESS**

Now, proceed through the following five stages *one by one*. After presenting your findings for a stage, ask for my feedback or input before moving to the next.

**Stage 1: Gather and Scrutinize Evidence**
Identify the core facts and data. Question everything.
* Where did this info come from?
* Who funded it?
* Is the sample size legit?
* Is this data still relevant?
* Where is the conflicting data?

**Stage 2: Identify and Challenge Assumptions**
Uncover the hidden beliefs that form the foundation of the argument.
* What are we assuming is true?
* What are my own hidden biases here?
* Would this hold true everywhere?
* What if we're wrong? What's the opposite?

**Stage 3: Explore Diverse Perspectives**
Break out of your own bubble.
* Who disagrees with this and why?
* How would someone from a different background see this?
* Who wins and who loses in this situation?
* Who did we not ask?

**Stage 4: Generate Alternatives**
Think outside the box.
* What's another way to approach this?
* What's the polar opposite of the current solution?
* Can we combine different ideas?
* What haven't we tried?

**Stage 5: Map and Evaluate Implications**
Think ahead. Every solution creates new problems.
* What are the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd-order consequences?
* Who is helped and who is harmed?
* What new problems might this create?

**FINAL SYNTHESIS**

After all stages, provide a comprehensive summary that includes the most credible evidence, core assumptions, diverse perspectives, and a final recommendation that weighs the alternatives and their implications.
