## Background summary

For the last ten years as AWS principal solution architect and an IBM distinguished engineer, I help customers adopt hybrid cloud, designing complex solutions around microservices, real-time streaming and data management for AI/ML. I'm currently helping customer adopting Generative AI models combined with traditional symbolic AI to get real actionable value from AI. 
During my carreer I have led consulting engagement in business process automation and decision automation with rule engine systems implementation. As CTO for event-driven architecture at IBM I have led event-driven and streaming solutions from strategic positioning at C-level to hands-on proof of technology for enterprise architects or lead developers.
Book author, conference speaker, I’m still hands-on to develop MVPs, proof of technology. 

I also contributed to multiple patents and publications on business rule models, IBM BPM and decision management integrations.

I am looking to guide customers to work on App modernization and cloud migration projects.
