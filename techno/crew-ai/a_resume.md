## Background summary

For the last ten years, as a former IBM distinguished engineer or AWS principal solution architect, I led customers to adopt hybrid cloud, designing complex solutions around event-driven architecture, data management for AI/ML, and application modernization using microservices, serverless and streaming.

During my career I have led consulting engagement in business process automation and decision automation with rule engine systems implementation. As CTO for event-driven architecture at IBM I have led event-driven and streaming solutions from strategic positioning at C-level to hands-on proof of technology for enterprise architects or lead developers.
I led the Data and AI ISV market solution architects, enabling software vendors to implement secured, distributed computing solutions to help them innovate to their own clients. I am currently leading Generative and Neuro-symbolic AI initiatives for enterprises. I also contributed to multiple patents and publications on business rule models, IBM BPM and decision management integrations.

Book author, conference speaker, I’m still hands-on to develop MVPs, proof of technology. 

I also contributed to multiple patents and publications on business rule models, IBM BPM and decision management integrations.
