## Background summary

With over seven years of experience in AI applications, I have been at the forefront of AI technologies, including deep learning, generative AI, and more. As a former AWS principal solution architect and an IBM distinguished engineer, I have helped customers adopt hybrid cloud solutions, designing intricate solutions around microservices, streaming, and data management for AI/ML. I have a robust background in statistical programming languages like PyTorch, which I've used in various AI applications.  

My recent work involves guiding customers in adopting Generative AI agents in combination with traditional symbolic AI, bringing about real actionable value from AI. I have significant experience in business process automation and decision automation with rule engine systems. As a conference speaker, I have delivered numerous technical presentations, sharing my knowledge and expertise in the field of AI and machine learning. 

I am proud to have contributed to multiple patents and publications on business rule models, IBM BPM and decision management integrations. I believe in owning outcomes and have made significant decisions in my roles, leading to substantial business impacts. I have been hands-on in developing MVPs and proof of technology, which is a testament to my commitment to innovation and growth in the field of AI. 

I am looking to leverage my extensive knowledge and experience in AI to guide customers to work on App modernization and cloud migration projects.
